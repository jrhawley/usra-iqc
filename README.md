The summary of my work during my four month co-op term at the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo.

## Summary

I worked on communication protocols using quantum information, and how basic message exchange could be done in an efficient manner over classical communication.
It was theoretical in nature, and involved Mathematica code to find the bounds on the communication complexity and "magic" [1] involved in the protocols I proposed.
